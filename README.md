# Flutter learning

This project includes multiple progressively more complex apps I created while learning Flutter mobile development. 

Apps are organized each on a different branch.

**Branches by name and purpose and concepts:**
- `Dice-Roller`: Allows users to  App configuration, scaffolding, assets usage and simple events.
- `QuizApp`: Allos users to answer a collection of multiple answer questions and review their results at the end. Multi page, events and more complex UI.
